# MiddleWare

## ReactJS Game Jam Project

MiddleWare is a small game project created for the Action Button [Goblin Bunker Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/goblin-bunker-game-jam-july-2024) for July 2024 with the prompt "the middle".

Check out the game on Itch.io: [https://17shinsen.itch.io/middleware](https://17shinsen.itch.io/middleware)

The game is written in ReactJS.

### Objective of the game

Play a variety of Micro Games revolving around the theme of
"the middle". Align construction materials, set the time,
micro-manage your employees!

Use the arrow keys and your mouse to complete the games.
